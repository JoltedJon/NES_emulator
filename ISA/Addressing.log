Implicit:
  Source and Destination implied from instruction

Accumulator:
  Operates directly on accumulator register

Immediate:
  Specify an 8 bit constant

Zero Page:
  Instruction does actions on the first 256 bytes (0x0000 -> 0x00FF)

Zero Page X:
Zero Page Y:
  Instruction index from 0 page using offset plus X/Y, index wraps around (0xFF + 0x0F -> 0x7F not 0x017F)

Relative:
  Used by branches, signed 8 bit relative offset (-128 -> 127) is added to PC

Absolute:
  Uses a full 16 bit address to indetify target location

Absolute X:
Absolute Y:
  16 bit address plus X/Y register

Indirect:
  16 bit pointer which points to least significant byte of 16 bit address, which is the real target address of instruction

Indexed Indirect:
  Pointer = Address + X (with zero page wrap around) which evaluates like indirect

Indirect Indexed:
  Same as previous but with Y
